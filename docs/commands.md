# Commands

Every command, option and exit code, generated from the program itself. For the same list as JSON, run
`clidev commands --json`.

**The first word is the profile**, a name you choose: `clidev personal config show`. `CLIDEV_PROFILE`
does the same for a whole shell session. No profile is assumed: a command that uses an account stops without one and
lists the profiles on this computer.

## Options for every command

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-V, --version` | output the version number. |
| `-v, --verbose` | more detail in what is shown: -v ids, -vv everything we know. Default: `0`. |
| `--json` | machine-readable output: one JSON value on stdout; --json=id,text keeps only those fields. |
| `--jsonl` | machine-readable output: one JSON object per line, for streaming and jq. |
| `--quiet` | diagnostics off; a failure is still said. |
| `--trace` | the connection's own log lines on stderr — never content. |
| `--debug` | on a failure, its whole record — cause and stack — in place of the short line. |
| `--timeout <duration>` | give up on the whole command after this — 30s, 2m, 500ms. |
| `--offline` | answer from what was recorded and never connect; fails if nothing was. |
| `--no-input` | never prompt or open interactive login; piped input remains available. |
| `--max-input-bytes <bytes>` | maximum buffered input bytes (default: 16777216). |
| `--max-output-bytes <bytes>` | maximum machine output bytes (default: 4194304; 0 disables). |
| `--brief` | found items as reference, title, time, author and excerpt only. |
| `--full` | found items with their whole text and every provider field. |
| `--compact` | one line per item for an agent: reference first, text last, paging and next steps as # lines. |
| `--dry-run` | preview parsed arguments and permissions before running the action. |
| `--yes` | go ahead without the question an ask level puts before a write. |
| `--record` | keep this run even where the config says record false; record_input false leaves the typed words out. |
| `--no-record` | do not keep this run, even if it fails. |

## `clidev commands`

every command by section; --json prints its contract, one path per call

### `clidev commands info`

one command contract, or all schemas, error reasons and explicit overrides

```sh
clidev commands info [path]
```

| Argument | | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | optional | one command path; without one, export schemas, error reasons and explicit overrides. |

**Returns:** one command contract, or all schemas, error reasons and explicit overrides

**Example:** `clidev commands info commands`

## `clidev session`

keep this profile's Example Comments token in the OS keyring

### `clidev session start`

sign this profile in: the Example Comments API token is asked hidden or read from stdin, never taken as an argument, checked against the service, and only then kept in the keyring, or in a private file

**Changes something on this computer only.**

```sh
clidev session start [options]
```

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--credential-storage <storage>` | where the token is kept: keyring, which falls back to a private file by itself, or file. Default: `keyring`. |

**Returns:** sign in to Example Comments with an API token

**Example:** `clidev personal session start`, `clidev personal session start --credential-storage file`

### `clidev session status`

show where this profile's token comes from: CLIDEV_TOKEN, the keyring or a file, never the token; --check asks Example Comments whose token it is

```sh
clidev session status [options]
```

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--check` | ask Example Comments whether the token still works, and whose it is. |

**Returns:** show where this profile's token comes from; never the token

**Example:** `clidev personal session status`, `clidev personal session status --check --json`

### `clidev session end`

forget this profile's token on this computer; the token itself stays valid in Example Comments

**Changes something on this computer only.**

```sh
clidev session end
```

**Returns:** forget this profile's token on this computer

**Example:** `clidev personal session end`

### `clidev session list`

list the profiles on this computer and whether each has a token; picks none

clidev session list
```

```

| Argument | | What it is |

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--limit <n>` | how many to show. |
| `--page <n>` | which page, starting at 1. |
| `--all` | every row, no paging. |

```sh
clidev comments show <id>

## `clidev skill`

### `clidev skill install`

write SKILL.md to \~/.claude/skills/clidev-app/ (Claude Code) and \~/.agents/skills/clidev-app/ (Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw); --for hermes also has Hermes read \~/.agents/skills, which changes Hermes's own settings, so all leaves it out

|---|---|
| `--for <agents>` | which agents to install for. One of: `claude`, `agents`, `hermes`, `all`. Default: `all`. |

```

**Returns:** whether the installed instructions for AI agents match this version

**Example:** `clidev skill status`, `clidev skill status --json`
